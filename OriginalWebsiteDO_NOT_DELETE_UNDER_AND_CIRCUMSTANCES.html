                    &ldquo;We opened our doors in 1974, my dad had one thing in mind: to serve great steaks and drinks
                    to his friends and family.  For 41 years we have stayed true to his vision.  We have added some things
                    along the way: wild game, homemade New Mexican food and a great selection of tequila
                    , however one thing hasn&rsquo;t changed- the steaks are still fantastic!&rdquo;

                <p>
                    When High Noon opened its doors in July of 1974, we added to the building's colorful history.
                    Originally constructed as a home sometime between 1750 and 1785, legend has it that the structure has
                    been both a gambling parlor and a brothel. With the addition of two rooms in the late 1960's, it
                    became home to a Spanish furniture maker as well as his retail storefront. The original building remained
                    an apartment until High Noon took over--its last tenant being a Catholic nun.
                </p>

                <p><em>Like a good ghost story?</em></p>

                <p>
                    Reminders of the buildings&rsquo; past lives are present in the spirits who still make it their home.
                    Customers and employees alike have many stories about their supernatural encounters--look for the lady
                    in the white dress who haunts the Santos Room. If you dare.

                    For your next special event, choose a uniquely New Mexican venue: High Noon Restaurant and Saloon.
                    Located in Old Town, Albuquerque&rsquo;s original settlement, and nestled in a historic 250 year old adobe
                    building, High Noon offers a taste of traditional New Mexican charm. Built in the rambling style of
                    Southwestern haciendas, the charm of brick floors, Kiva fireplaces and viga ceilings await you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Make any special event truly unique by booking one of our semi-private rooms and enjoying
                    a menu that reflects your personal taste and style. It has been our privilege to be a part of
                    thousands of significant celebrations over the years and our staff excels at creating festive and memorable

                    just another impersonal hotel ballroom wedding reception that could be in any city in the country. Add some
                    local flavor to any celebration---rehearsal dinners, bridal showers and baby showers.
                </p>
