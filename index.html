                    “When we opened our doors in 1974, my dad had one thing in mind: 
                    to serve great steaks and drinks to his friends and family. For 
                    44 years we have stayed true to his vision. We have added 
                    some things along the way: wild game, homemade New 
                    Mexican food and a great selection of tequila, however one 
                    thing hasn’t changed- the steaks are still fantastic!”
